# Lifting Line Code
matlab code for solving the clasical "3D potential flow around a wing" problem using Prandlt's lifting-line theory aproach

An iterative solution was implemented, along with the clasical glauert solution (keep un mind that glauert solution diverges if the number of partitions n is too big (n=20 is the recomended)). 

Only two sets of airfoil's data are available as .mat files. Still missing a function to parse TR824 database.

Several types of wing shapes and geometric warpage are implemented. Still not available aerodynamic warpage.
